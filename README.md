# WorkbenchOrganizer

This is a [Mutagen](https://github.com/Mutagen-Modding/Mutagen)-based autopatcher for Fallout 4, intended for use with [Synthesis](https://github.com/Mutagen-Modding/Synthesis).

## Description

Autopatches workbench recipes, for usage with [Organized Workbench Menu](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/32588).

### Important

To ensure save compatibility, you should enable FormID persistence in Synthesis.
To do this, in Synthesis, go to Settings (the gear symbol) → Profiles → Fallout 4, and set "FormID Persistence" to "Text".


## Requirements
Organized Workbench Menu, for obvious reasons.
